# GNSS-REFLECTOMETRY-PROCESSING

The main goal of the project is to process reflected GNSS signals to obtain Earth measurements.
This program is using the GPU to accelerate the computation time. For a input signal of a GNSS reflected signal
makes the cross-correlation and gives as output all the information of the peak of correlation.

All the contents were developed for the [Passive Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSLab)](http://www.tsc.upc.edu/rslab/Passive%20Remote%20Sensing/welcome) of the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu/?set_language=en).

New versions of this program may be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/oriolcervello/GNSS-REFLECTOMETRY-PROCESSING/) 

## Contents
Project is still under development, further information and modifications will be added.

## Installation of CUDA

Here are a little instructions on how to run (in Windows) the program if you do not have CUDA.

Requirements of all you need a pc with a Nvidia GPU able to run CUDA.

Insturctions: 

1. Install [VisualStudio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), required by CUDA. Ensure to add C++ Packages, specially SDKs.
2. If you got old GPU drivers or you want to update them I recomend running [DDU](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) to clean the GPU before installing new drivers.
3. Download [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
4. I recomend Personalized installation and just install CUDA option which is the CUDA itself and the Driver component if you want to update it. If you want to update drivers don't forget step 2.
5. Ensure to have on Path the following ones:
c:\program files\nvidia gpu computing toolkit\cuda\v10.0\libnvvp;
c:\program files\nvidia gpu computing toolkit\cuda\v10.0\bin;
c:\program files (x86)\microsoft visual studio\2017\community\vc\tools\msvc\14.15.26726\bin\hostx64\x64;

Now CUDA should be working fine.

To build the program go to the Build and Run section.

## Build and Run

To build the program open the directory on the Powershell.

You can build the program with the following comand:

    nvcc extra/TextParser.cu functions.cu main.cu -lnpps -lcufft -o main

To run it, we will need to pass 2 arguments:
1. input.ASE (or whatever name is your input configuration file with that format)
2. number of datalines to process on that run

Also on the PowerShell: (example: 1: input.ASE 2: 4 datalines)

    .\kernel input.ASE 4


## Configuration File (input.ASE)
In this file you will need to fill each variable with the argument desired.

    *FFTSIZE 32768  <---Size of the FFT
    *NUMOFFFTS 20  <---# of FFT to do simultaneously in one dataline
    *QUANTINCOHAVER 4   <---# of coherent IFFT to averag for the incoherent
    *OVERLAP 32  <---Samples of overlap
    *FSAMPLING 32736000  <---Sampling Freq. [hz]
    *BLOCKSIZE 1024  <---Threads per blok(to know max thread/blok of your GPU go to other directory)
    *PEAKRANGESTD 64  <---Samples to avoid arround the peak for the STD computation (Peak in the mid sample)
    *PEAKSAMPLESTOSAVE 311  <---Samples to save arround the peak (Peak in the mid sample)
    *QUANTDATALINES 4  <--- Datalines to compute should be de same as argument 2

Datalines should have this format: DataFileName BeginingOfData EndOfData DopplerFreq RefSignalFileName

    *DATALINE datafiles/prn_L1CA_32_100.bin 0 654752 0 datafiles/prn_L1CA_32.bin


## Outputs
The results will be stored on results directory.

There is a ReadMe.md on results directory.
