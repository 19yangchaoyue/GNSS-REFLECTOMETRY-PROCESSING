Instructions to read float files will be added.

This are files of example:

### prn_L1CA_32_100.bin

Contains 100 times prn signal of a size of 32736 samples each. 
(Each sample is a complex number of float of 32bits for the real part and  float of 32bits for imaginary part)

### prn_L1CA_32_100_fd_1e3.bin

The same as prn_L1CA_32_100.bin but with a doppler of 1000 Hz.

### prn_L1CA_32_100_noisy.bin

The same as prn_L1CA_32_100.bin but with added random noise.

### prn_L1CA_32.bin

Contains 1 times prn signal of a size of 32736 samples each. Used for Reference signal for a DATALINE.
(Each sample is a complex number of float of 32bits for the real part and  float of 32bits for imaginary part)
